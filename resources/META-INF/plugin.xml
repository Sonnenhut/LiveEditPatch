**IntelliJ plugin to "patch" [WEB-30653](https://youtrack.jetbrains.net/issue/WEB-30653)**

IntelliJ throws a warning when editing JavaScript modules: "Editing module's script is not supported"

As per documentation LiveEdit should at least rerun the debugger, but it does not.

This Plugin will restart the debugger whenever the above message appears.

This is not really a fix/patch, but a workaround because I cannot access/edit the sources for the Plugin.

This bug was moved to the status "Obsolete". But it is still reproduciblein version:
